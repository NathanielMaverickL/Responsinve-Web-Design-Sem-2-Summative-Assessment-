        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            Swedish Recipes is a student-made web application designed to showcase
            traditional Swedish dishes in a clean, modern, and user-friendly way.
            The project combines cultural appreciation with fundamental web
            development principles, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and
            consistent visual design.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website was developed as part of an academic project, with the goal
            of creating an intuitive browsing experience while demonstrating the
            practical use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The content and layout are
            structured to be easy to navigate and visually balanced across different
            screen sizes.

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this project is to present Swedish recipes in a
                clear and organized manner. By using a card-based layout, users can
                easily browse through different dishes without feeling overwhelmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project also serves as a practical exercise in front-end web
                development, allowing the application of layout techniques,
                responsive design, and basic user interaction.

            <h3>Design Theme</h3>
            <p>
                The visual design is inspired by Scandinavian aesthetics, which
                emphasize simplicity, functionality, and minimalism. The use of
                yellow and blue tones is inspired by the Swedish flag, creating a
                recognizable and cohesive identity across the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clean spacing, soft shadows, and subtle hover effects are used to
                enhance readability and user focus while maintaining a calm and
                approachable interface.

            <h3>Built With</h3>
            <p>
                This project was built using core web technologies including HTML
                for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for basic
                interactivity such as modals and dynamic content display.
            </p>
            <p>
                No external frameworks were used in order to strengthen foundational
                development skills and maintain full control over the design and
                behavior of the website.

        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            The design philosophy behind Swedish Recipes is rooted in Scandinavian
            principles of simplicity, clarity, and functionality. Every design
            decision was made to support ease of use and visual balance.
        </p>
        <p>
            By limiting the color palette and focusing on clean layouts, the website
            avoids unnecessary distractions and allows users to focus on the content.
            This approach reflects both Swedish design culture and modern web
            usability standards.
